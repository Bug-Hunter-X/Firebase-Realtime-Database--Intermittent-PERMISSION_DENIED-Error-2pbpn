# Firebase Realtime Database: Intermittent PERMISSION_DENIED Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue with Firebase's Realtime Database: receiving a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error even when the security rules seem perfectly configured. This often stems from subtle timing issues, caching on the client or server, or unexpected behavior in rule evaluation. The error message itself is not always helpful in diagnosing the root cause.

The `bug.js` file shows an example scenario where this error might occur, and `bugSolution.js` provides potential solutions and workarounds.
